# NumberOfVowels
This is a GUI based program that asks a user to input a string
and then extracts that string using an input dialog. After that the program
will determine the number of characters in the string, the total number of
each type of vowel in the string (includeing lowercase and uppercase instances)
and then display the string, the number of characters and the number of each
type of vowel in an output dialog. The program will then ask the user if they
want to enter another string and if they do, it will display the same
information (user's string, number of characters and number of each type of vowel)
in an output dialog. The program will continue to ask the if the user wants to enter
another string until the user enters 'No' or 'no.'
